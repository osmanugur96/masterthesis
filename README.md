# Under Uncertainty Decision Making: A Novel Bayesian Approach to Portfolio Optimization
## Abstract
Modern people receive a great deal of information, its simplification would help the
community draw conclusions about positive trends. Decision making under uncer-
tainty can be quite difficult for some people; however, if they are given enough infor-
mation, we can be sure that a considerable amount will find a way to reach the right
verdict. The most significant issue would be supplying them with enough information
without overwhelming them with meaningless details.
As complexity in the markets continue to increase exponentially; most reasonable
investors stick to fundamentals to make their investment decisions. However; going
through great amounts of financial data requires tremendous amount of time and man-
power, which most retail investors presumably lack. In this paper, I present a flexible
framework to condense publicly available data into an interpretable and intuitive form.
